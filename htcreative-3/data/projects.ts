    story: `One month after venturing out on my own to form HT Creative, a colleague of mine called to see if w wanted to assist her marketing department with some proofreading. That marketing department just so happened to be the in-house team for Gulfstream Aerospace, the world’s leading manufacturer of technologically advanced business-jet aircraft. I, of course, said yes.
    
    A few interviews and weeks later, I was able to demonstrate my abilities beyond proofreading and HT Creative was hired as the creative consultant for Gulfstream’s marketing department. My main focus at Gulfstream was creative copywriting including product brochures, print advertisements, specialty mailings and even a museum-like installation documenting the history of the company at its home office.
    
    Among those many creative endeavors, developing the print campaign for the launch of the G650 is, undoubtedly, a highlight. Seeing my words on a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal was definitely up there; fitting for an aircraft, don’t you agree?`,

Paragon created this series with Automattic for WordPress.com to both bring to light and also explain its most often-used attributes including: Security, CSS vs HTML, Code, Personas, Colors and Fonts, and Photos – among others.
    
    After a few collaborative sessions with Paragon, I set to work writing scripts on each topic then submitted them to Paragon to bring those words to life and give illustrative meaning to complex topics. Did you know WordPress could do all of this? Now you do…`,

    description: 'Print and advertising copy for logistics company Trailer Bridge.',
    story: `When I’m traveling along Interstate 95 and I pass by a semi-truck hauling a gray container with a big blue and white “TB” on the side, I smile. Why? Because I know the people behind that TB – and they’re the good ones. The ones who actually answer the phone for their clients and go far beyond the job description to get the job done right. It’s rare and it’s beautiful.
    
    TB stands for Trailer Bridge, a trusted source for asset-based logistics services, ocean shipping, NVOCC, and 3PL services throughout North America, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and the Virgin Islands. It’s easy to think all logistics companies are roughly the same – but Trailer Bridge is teaching customers to reconsider that notion with creative marketing that’s as different as the company itself. This particular ad was created to speak to the heart of Trailer Bridge: its people. Automated phone systems are not what wins a customer’s loyalty; it’s the people on the other end – the ones customers talk with every time they call Trailer Bridge. What a concept, right?

    Concept: David vs Goliath
    Trailer Bridge has been around for more than 30 years and has grown tremendously during that time. Even so, compared to some other ‘giants’ in the logistics world, Trailer Bridge is the young kid with a lot to prove. Which, if you think about it, is a good thing. It means Trailer Bridge is going to work harder – and smarter – putting the latest technologies and a whole lotta’ heart into everything they do. Their story reminded me of the Biblical story of David and Goliath – and the lesson from that story, as told in this print ad – powerfully captures the essence of Trailer Bridge.`,

    story: `I’ve had the honor of working with Paragon Design Group for the Savannah Economic Authority (SEDA) since 2008. Year after year, we’re offered unique opportunities to flex our creativity – from inventive gift mailers for Thanksgiving and St. Patrick’s Day (a quintessential Savannah celebration) to banners for trade shows, print advertisements to digital annual reports and more – SEDA has entrusted us with keeping their core mission and message in the spotlight for its global prospects: to help create, grow and attract new job opportunities and investment in the Savannah region.
    
    The team at SEDA is astounding and when given the chance to collaborate with SEDA and Paragon, I’m quite sure an actual lightbulb begins to glow atop my head with idea generation that is as fun as it is fundamental to the continued growth of this region we call home.`,

    Georgia Southern University is a force to be reckoned with. Its three campuses in Statesboro, Hinesville and Savannah, Georgia serve nearly thirty-thousand students offering approximately 140 different degree programs. For this project, our goal was to convey the innovation of this progressive campus while retaining its hometown charm. Even after 10 straight days of shooting, I still got chills watching the end product – and I hope you do, too. Go Eagles!`,

    story: `Life has a way of getting carpets dirty – really dirty. Footprints, muddy paws, spilled drinks – before you know it, your carpets are beyond what a household vacuum can do. That’s where Zerorez comes in. Fun fact, Zerorez is a palindrome – spelled the same forward and backward! It’s also short for “zero residue” the major selling point of the company’s ZR™ Water technology that uses powered water – not wet soaps – to get carpets cleaner than traditional cleaning methods.
    
    The challenge with Zerorez is to clearly convey who they are, what they do, describe the science but keep it simple, and also get an offer and call to action within a 30-second time limit. Challenge accepted!
    
    I have the pleasure of working with the uber-talented Blue Reef Studios to create television spots for Zerorez Atlanta and its seven markets along with other Zerorez franchises throughout the country. So without further delay, I hope you’ll enjoy this sampling of Zerorez television creative (and if you suddenly feel like your carpets are flat-out filthy…well, now you know who to call)!`,

    Chemist Spirits won first place in the annual WNC Best of Competition; Distillery of the Year and Mixologist of the Year at the North Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association’s Chef Showdown; and Double Gold at the Women’s Wine and Spirits Award for its Chemist American Gin. They definitely know what they’re doing. And they also knew the story they wanted to tell, which made it a magical collaboration in every way.
    
    Why ‘Chemist’? As the story on the label goes, back in the days of prohibition, the Chemists were the ones who kept “booze” flowing – legally of course – and Chemist Spirits pays homage to their inventive efforts. Fun to write, even more fun to mix in a cocktail. Cheers!`,

    Paragon was hired by McGraw Hill to create an explainer video that would reach their target audience with this new service and provide them with a solid basis of information to find out more.

Personally, professionally, creatively – it is a pleasure and blessing to work with them, no matter the project (though every project with them is phenomenal).
    
    This particular assignment was for Paragon’s client, Happy Returns. As the name suggests, Happy Returns transforms the nagging chore of online returns into a happy experience. Being new to the market required a little explanation – both to customers who would use them as well as retailers serving as Happy Returns sites (who ultimately benefit from the increased foot traffic in their stores). So, we helped them explain their service with an animated explainer video – my words, Paragon’s brilliance and voila – introducing, Happy Returns.`,

Several years later, after she was well on her way with Chandley, Inc. and I was just starting HT Creative, our paths crossed again and have continued to happily intertwine ever since. Robin is a master at all things media – digital, social, television, radio, programmatic video – and I get the pleasure of regular collaborations with Robin and her team for a variety of clients – one of those being, Arlington Toyota in Jacksonville, Fl.
    
    Arlington has been family owned and operated in Jacksonville for more than 40 years and each month we’re given the opportunity to develop television, radio, digital display ads, landing page layouts and email designs in keeping with Toyota’s national promotions or, in a non-promo month, a theme of the dealer’s choosing. One of the things I love most about working with Robin and Arlington Toyota is the immediate impact we know our creative efforts have on their bottom line; words may be my passion, but numbers tell an important tale when it comes to automotive sales.
